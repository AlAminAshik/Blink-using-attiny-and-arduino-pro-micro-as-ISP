//This code shows how to upload a code to attiny using arduino as ISP in Platformio
//at first upload code to arduino as ISP from arduino ide>example>arduinoISP
//next connect the arduino to attiny
//then select the board as attiny85 and programmer as arduino as ISP
//IMP since arduino pro micro is used which uses atmega32U4, a significant change has to be done in platform.ini file
//for other arduino board such as arduino ide this is not needed.
